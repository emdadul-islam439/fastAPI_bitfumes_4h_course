## FastApi read file line by line. So, position the functions 'carefully'
    * place "@app.get('/blog/unpublished')" before "@app.get('/blog/{id}')"
        -> if the 'id' variable is 'int', then 'unpublished' will be 'un-acceptable' becasue of being 'string'

## By the use of 'Optional', we can reduce the number of functions to call 
    * used optional query-parameter into the index(...) functions  
        -> because of this, we have able to remove two redundant function call


## for debugging purposes, you can run the file in different port
    * import uvicorn
    * type 'python3 main.py' to run
    * can output as the other methods
    -> if __name__ == "__main__":
            uvicorn.run(app, host = "127.0.0.1", port = 9000)
